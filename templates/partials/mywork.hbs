        <h2>Timber Threads</h2>
        <p>This is a brand I created over 5 years ago. This site has evolved into many different looks. I’ve also treated this site as a Font-end playground, where I can try new Front-end technologies. Last year, my very talented friend Marco, wanted to redesign the site for a portfolio piece. I jumped at the opportunity for him to give the site a long overdue face-lift. This is what we ended up with.</p>

        <h2>Timber Hockey</h2>
        <p>This is a company that I co-founded with my partner in 2013.  I handle the creative side of the company from stick designs to the overall look and feel of the site.  The site is built on the Bigcommerce platform and was designed by myself.  I wanted to create something unique, but simple.</p>

        <h2>Pat Ortiz <span>Photography</span></h2>
        <p>I’ve been dabbling with photography for about 3 years now. Naturally because I am front-end developer, I wanted something to display my work. So, this is a little splash page I put up to try a few new things. This is another site I get to experiment with new technologies. I felt like this was a nice look for a temporary page, while I am currently working on getting the new version up and running. </p>

        <h2>Edel Golf</h2>
        <p>This was a site I worked on for my current company TechPines. The client had a site on Shopify and was looking for a entire site makeover. After given the design, I created a responsive website using Bootstrap framework on the Shopify platform. </p>
